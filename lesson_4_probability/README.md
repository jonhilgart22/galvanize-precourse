## Lesson 4: Probability

A basic understanding of probability and statisitics is vital to becoming a
data scientist. Afterall, that is what makes you different from a software
engineer. Please complete this chapter before moving on to the next lesson on statistics.

If you feel like you need a review, [Khan Academy's probability course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability) is highly recommended. Here are the relevant sections:

- [Independent and dependent events](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/independent-dependent-probability)
- [Probability and combinatorics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/probability-and-combinatorics-topic)
	- [Permutations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/probability-and-combinatorics-topic#permutations)
	- [Combinations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/probability-and-combinatorics-topic#combinations-combinatorics)
	- [Probability using combinatorics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/probability-and-combinatorics-topic#probability-combinatorics)
- [Random variables and probability distributions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/random-variables-topic)
- [Normal distribution](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/statistics-inferential#normal-distribution)

In addition, there are very abridged lecture notes in
the ```readings``` folder that will catch you up to speed. They are in PDF, so you need to download the repo to view them. If you feel the lecture notes are insufficient, please reach out to us.

Here is a recommended reading order:

- combinatorics_lecture
- conditional_probability_lecture
- random_variables_lecture
- binomial_lecture
- poisson_lecture
- normal_exponential_lecture  

There are 10 questions in ```probability_assignment.md``` covering various aspects of basic probability theory. They represent the baseline understanding you need to have about probability to understand the course material we are going to cover in the first minimester.

It is equally important that you __show the steps__ to arrive at the answer and arrive at the right answer.

Please fill in your solution in the ```probability_assignment.md```. Do that by downloading the repo (which you should already have done). Then open ```probability_assignment.md``` in a text editor.

__Fill in your solution to each question right below the question before the next question starts.__
