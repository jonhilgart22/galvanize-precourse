Lesson 2: Python

__Read all instructions below, then fill in the functions provided for you the Jupyter Notebooks.__ 

Practice makes perfect, therefore our first official Galvanize assignments will be just that. Practicing python. In particular we'll be getting more comfortable with Python built-in data structures and functions.

We are __not__ going to turn you into software eningeers. However, we will be devloping computational thinking. Programming is one manifestation of computational thinking. Programming is the science of abstraction: creating the right model for a problem, representing it in a computer, and then devising appropriate automated techniques to solve the problem within the model. Programming in Python encourages computational thinking at the right level of abstraction.

The course will heavily use Python for projects and homework. It is not necessary to be an expert in Python coming into the course (that is what we will teach you!) but the most familiar with the basics you are, the easier the program will be.

Follow the installation instructions directly below to get setup. Then continue on to the assignments.

Installing Python
----

We use the [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) Python 3.5 (not Python 2.7) distribution and [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) to run Python. You should install all those items now and make sure they are working on your system.

Assignment Overview
----

#### 1. Practice with built-ins

Fill in the functions in [1_general_python_pratice_problems.ipynb](1_general_python_pratice_problems.ipynb).

These are all one-liners that use a bunch of handy built-in functions.


#### 3. Fizz Buzz fun with Python

FizzBuzz is infamous for being a simple programming problem that [a lot of software
engineers struggle with](http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/).

Implement the function `fizzbuzz` in [3_fizzbuzz.ipynb](3_fizzbuzz.ipynb).
 
#### 2. Generating text

Fill in the functions `word_counts`, `associated_words` and `make_random_story` in [2_processing_words_in_python.ipynb](2_processing_words_in_python.ipynb). These will give you practice with reading files, strings and dictionaries.

Take a look at the [Collections module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html), in particular `DefaultDict` and `Counter` may simplify your code.
