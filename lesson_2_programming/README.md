Lesson 2: Python

__Read all instructions below, then fill in the functions provided for you the Jupyter Notebooks.__ 

Practice makes perfect, therefore our first official Galvanize assignments will be just that. Practicing python. In particular we'll be getting more comfortable with Python built-in data structures and functions.

We are __not__ going to turn you into software engineers. However, we will be developing computational thinking. Programming is one manifestation of computational thinking. Programming is the science of abstraction: creating the right model for a problem, representing it in a computer, and then devising appropriate automated techniques to solve the problem within the model. Programming in Python encourages computational thinking at the right level of abstraction.

The course will heavily use Python for projects and homework. It is not necessary to be an expert in Python coming into the course (that is what we will teach you!) but the most familiar with the basics you are, the easier the program will be.

Follow the installation instructions directly below to get setup. Then continue on to the assignments.

Installing Python
----

We use the [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) Python 3.5 (not Python 2.7) distribution and [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) to run Python. You should install all those items now and make sure they are working on your system.

Assignment Overview
----

#### 1. Practice manipulating numbers

Fill in the functions in [1_number_fundamentals.ipynb](1_number_fundamentals.ipynb).

#### 2. Practice manipulating text

Fill in the functions in [2_text_fundamentals.ipynb](2_text_fundamentals.ipynb).

##### 3. Practice common programming operations

Fill in the functions in [3_operations.ipynb](3_operations.ipynb).

#### 4. Fizz Buzz fun with Python

FizzBuzz is infamous for being a simple programming problem that programmers can struggle with.

Implement the function `fizzbuzz` in [4_fizzbuzz.ipynb](4_fizzbuzz.ipynb).
