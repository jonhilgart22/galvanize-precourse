    "- For those familiar with Python 2's _xrange_, there is no _xrange_ in Python 3. Python 3's _range_ __replaces__ Python 2's _xrange_. Hence, Python 3 _range_ is memory efficient, as you won't store a full list in memory, only the generator.   \n",
    "\n",
    "First look at a bit of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1000):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range` function will create an object that can iterate over 1000 numbers.  The `range` function will generate the next value when it's needed, but won't pre-generate everything. If you actually want a list of numbers, then use list(range(1000)) to force the integers out.  "

    "## Sets and Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has some specialized datatypes that come in very handy!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are an implementation of hash tables (like Java's hashmaps if you're familiar with them). It's basically a way of matching key, value pairs. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(homestate['katie'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are more powerful than they first appear. It's import to note that it's always really fast to access a dictionary. In a list, if you want to find an element without having the index, you have to search through the whole list. In a dictionary, you can access an element by key quickly!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Looping over dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple ways of iterating through a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for k in d:\n",
    "    # iterations over the keys, so k will take on a different key for each iteration through the loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "for k, v in d.items():\n",
    "    # iterates over key, value pairs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `d.items()` creates a `view` object, which is a view into the dictionary. A view is not a list, generator, nor set, but it has the best properties of each one. A view 'looks' like a list, so you can see inside it, but the `view` object does not have list methods like append. A view is like a generator in that it takes very little memory; however, you can iterate through a view multiple times, which you cannot do with a generator. A view is a like a set in that it finds membership very fast because a view retains hashing properties of the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking membership in a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to check if a key is in a dictionary, just do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if k in d:\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "DO NOT do `if k in d.keys():`. \n",
    "Notice: In Python 2, this would be horribly inefficient as d.keys() with return a list, which takes memory. Checking through a list is also slow since you might have to go through every element in the list to determine if element __k__ is a key in dictionary __d__. In Python 3, this line of code is pretty fast as `d.keys()` returns a `view` object instead of a list, but adding the `.keys()` is considered unPythonic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick note: a view is dynamic and will change if there is a change in the underlying dictionary. For example, if you create a view using `.keys()`, then it will be automatically updated if you delete or add a key to the original dictionary."
