    "### Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "First look at this bit of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1000):\n",
    "    print i\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range` function will create a list of length 1000 and then we iterate over it. This is very wasteful for space! We don't need to create a list of 1000 elements and store it in memory! We can use a -generator- to save the memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in xrange(1000):\n",
    "    print i\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `xrange` function will generate the next value when it's needed, but won't pre-generate everything like the `range` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see other examples of generators below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looping tools\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple handy tools in python that help you clean up your code when you're looping through a list. First, when possible, use the most simple pythonic loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for item in L:\n",
    "    print item\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enumerate\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to know the index, you've probably seen code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in xrange(len(L)):\n",
    "    print i, L[i]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But you should really use `enumerate` (a generator!):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i, item in enumerate(L):\n",
    "    print i, item\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Isn't that cleaner?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zip\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have two lists and you want to loop over both of them at the same time. You could do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_names = ['Giovanna', 'Ryan', 'Jon']\n",
    "last_names = ['Thron', 'Orban', 'Dinu']\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in xrange(len(first_names)):\n",
    "    print first_names[i], last_names[i]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But python has a handy `zip` function to zip two lists together:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [3]: zip(first_names, last_names)\n",
    "Out[3]: [('Giovanna', 'Thron'), ('Ryan', 'Orban'), ('Jon', 'Dinu')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're going to loop over it, you should use `izip` instead, since it's a generator. You'll need to import `izip` from the `itertools` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from itertools import izip\n",
    "\n",
    "for first, last in izip(first_names, last_names):\n",
    "    print first, last\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want like a combination of zip and enumerate, you can do the following and have the index and the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from itertools import izip, count\n",
    "\n",
    "for i, first, last in izip(count(), first_names, last_names):\n",
    "    print i, first, last\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## List comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple things, you can do your for loop on one line. Let's say you want to create a new list that has all the items from the first list doubled. You could do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "doubled = []\n",
    "for item in L:\n",
    "    doubled.append(item - 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But using a list comprehension, you can do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "doubled = [item - 2 for item in L]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2D list comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can similarly do a double for loop. This is what it would look like the standard way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "L = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
    "doubled = []\n",
    "for row in L:\n",
    "    row2 = []\n",
    "    for item in row:\n",
    "        row2.append(item - 2)\n",
    "    doubled.append(row2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And with a list comprehension:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "doubled = [[item - 2 for item in row] for row in L]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you wanted to flatten a 2-dimesionsional list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: L = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: [item for row in L for item in row]\n",
    "Out[2]: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the order of the loop statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### If statements in list comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "If statements have a weird syntax in a list comprehension:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [3]: L = [4, 6, 3, 2, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [4]: [\"even\" if item % 2 == 0 else \"odd\" for item in L]\n",
    "Out[4]: ['even', 'even', 'odd', 'even', 'odd']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use an if statement as a filter, to only include some of the items. Here we include only the even numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [5]: L = [4, 6, 3, 2, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [6]: [item for item in L if item % 2 == 0]\n",
    "Out[6]: [4, 6, 2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generator comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make it a generator instead of a list if you're just going to be looping over the result. You do this by using round brackets instead of square ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "L = [\"zack desario\", \"giovanna thron\", \"ryan orban\", \"jonathan dinu\"]\n",
    "for name in (item.split()[0] for item in L):\n",
    "    print name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is if you're just going to put the result into another function that can use a generator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: L = [\"zack desario\", \"giovanna thron\", \"ryan orban\", \"jonathan dinu\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: \"-\".join(item.split()[0] for item in L)\n",
    "Out[2]: 'zack-giovanna-ryan-jonathan'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lambda Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use `lambda` to define unnamed functions. This is really useful for being able to customize `sort` and use functions like `map`, `filter` and `reduce`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sort by first element of tuple\n",
    "L = [(2, 4), (5, 3), (6, 8), (4, 1)]\n",
    "L.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All things you can do with list comprehensions you can also do with `map`. It's more \"Pythonic\" to use list comprehensions, but understanding how to write maps is key for numpy and pandas, modules we will be using heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Double every element of a list\n",
    "def double_list(L):\n",
    "    return map(lambda x: x - 2, L)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The if statement syntax is very similar to list comprehension syntax. Here's the same example (double positive numbers but not negative numbers):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "map(lambda x: x - 2 if x > 0 else x, L)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `map` with already implemented functions, like `abs` (absolute value):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "L = [0, 5, -8, 9, -3, -2]\n",
    "M = map(abs, L)  # [0, 5, 8, 9, 3, 2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The build-in `reduce` can be used to implement aggregation functions. Here's an implementation of `sum` (if sum wasn't already implemented in python):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sum(L):\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    for x in L:\n",
    "        total += x\n",
    "    return total\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can do this so much more simply if we use `reduce`. Here `total` is the running total and `x` is the new element from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sum(L):\n",
    "    return reduce(lambda total, x: total + x, L)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And here's a `len` function. Note that we gave an initial value of 0. The default initial value is the first element of the list, which works fine for `sum`, but not for `len`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def len(L):\n",
    "    return reduce(lambda total, x: total + 1, L, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sets and Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has some specialized datatypes that come in very handy!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are an implementation of hash tables (like Java's hashmaps if you're familiar with them). It's basically a way of matching key, value pairs. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "homestate = {\"giovanna\": \"maine\", \"ryan\": \"california\", \"katie\": \"michigan\", \"zack\": \"new york\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily lookup a person's homestate like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print homestate['katie']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are more powerful than they first appear. It's import to note that it's always really fast to access a dictionary. In a list, if you want to find an element without having the index, you have to search through the whole list. In a dictionary, you can access an element by key quickly!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Looping over dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple ways of iterating through a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for k in d:\n",
    "    # iterations over the keys\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "DO NOT do `for k in d.keys()`. This is completely unneccessary. You are creating a list of all your keys which is a waste of time and space.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for k, v in d.iteritems():\n",
    "    # iterates over key, value pairs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `iteritems` is a generator, so it's preferred over `items` when you're looping.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking membership in a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to check if a key is in a dictionary, just do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if k in d:\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "DO NOT do `if k in d.keys():`. This is horribly inefficient. You are creating a list of your keys and then searching in a list. Searching in a list is slow, but searching in a dictionary is fast! Keep it as a dictionary to get all the speed power of dictionaries! You can also add and remove to a dictionary quickly. Lists are only fast if you are adding or removing from the end (if you change the beginning, you have to slide all the elements over to make or fill in space).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counter and defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "You are very often using dictionaries to count things or where the type is always the same. In the module `collections` there are a couple useful datatypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Counter` and `defaultdict` have default values for keys that haven't been seen before. For a `Counter`, the default value will be 0. For a `defaultdict`, the default value will be dependent on what you give it.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a standard dictionary, you can't access a new key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: d = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: d['abc']\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)\n",
    "<ipython-input-6-e51fd128be60> in <module>()\n",
    "----> 1 d['abc']\n",
    "\n",
    "KeyError: 'abc'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But with a `Counter` or `defaultdict`, this would be no problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: from collections import Counter, defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: c = Counter()\n",
    "\n",
    "In [3]: c['abc']\n",
    "Out[3]: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "In [4]: d = defaultdict(str)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [5]: d['abc']\n",
    "Out[5]: ''\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `d` here has a default value of an empty string since we gave it the argument `str`. Besides how they deal with new keys, these two datatypes work the same as standard dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to get a count of the number of occurrences of each character in a string. You could do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "letter_count = {}\n",
    "for char in word:\n",
    "    letter_count[char] = letter_count.get(char, 0) + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use `Counter`, you can just do this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import Counter\n",
    "letter_count = Counter(word)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have a list. You want to know all the indicies that each value appears on. With a stardard dictionary, you could do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lst = ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'c', 'a']\n",
    "d = {}\n",
    "for i, item in enumerate(lst):\n",
    "    if item in d:\n",
    "        d[item].append(i)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        d[item] = [i]\n",
    "# result: {'a': [0, 2, 6], 'b': [1], 'c': [3, 5], 'd': [4]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A `defaultdict` lets you choose a default type for the values so you don't have to do a special case when it's not already in your dictionary. The following code does the same as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "d = defaultdict(list)\n",
    "for i, item in enumerate(lst):\n",
    "    d[item].append(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are basically value-less dictionaries. If you have a list that you're going to be regularly checking membership of, you should be using a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to get all the unique words in a string that are longer than 3 characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = set()\n",
    "for word in string.split():\n",
    "    if len(word) > 3:\n",
    "        s.add(word)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check membership in a set:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if 'house' in s:\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding to and checking membership in a set are fast operations (just like in a dictionary).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are also useful for removing duplicates in a list (if you don't care about order):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "L_unique = list(set(L))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Order of dictionaries and sets\n",
    "Dictionaries and sets are --unordered--. This means that if you iterate through them multiple times you will not necessarily get the items in the same order (though computers are deterministic so it will often be the same order, but it is in no way a guarantee). Usually this doesn't matter. There is an `OrderedDict` datatype in the `collections` module if it is ever important to maintain the order in your dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mutable vs Immutable\n",
    "\n",
    "Python datatypes can be mutable or immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable datatypes can be modified after they are created. Examples of --mutable-- datatypes are:\n",
    "- lists\n",
    "- sets\n",
    "- dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable datatypes cannot be modified once they are created. Examples of --immutable-- datatypes are:\n",
    "- ints\n",
    "- floats\n",
    "- strings\n",
    "- tuples (like immutable lists)\n",
    "\n",

    "### File Input\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to read from a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred way of reading a file is by looping over the lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"myfile.txt\")\n",
    "for line in f:\n",
    "    # do something\n",

    "```\n",

    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"myfile.txt\")\n",
    "line = True\n",
    "while line:\n",
    "    line = f.readline()\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also two functions for reading the whole file at once: `read` (returns the whole file as a string) and `readlines` (returns the file as a list of strings). It is generally bad form to use these. They load the whole file into memory, which will be really costly with a large file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you forget to close the file, you can also use this syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"myfile.txt\") as f:\n",
    "    # do stuff with the file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes this is nice, but if you have a lot of nested indentations it can make your code hard to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Output\n",
    "\n",
    "To write to a file, you just need to add a \"w\" parameter when you open the file and then use the `write` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"out.txt\", 'w')\n",
    "f.write(\"Hello!\\n\")\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it won't automatically add new lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `'w'` parameter will overwrite the file. If you'd like to add to the end of the file instead, you can use the `'a'` parameter.\n",

    "## Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "You can catch exceptions in python with the following syntax:\n",
