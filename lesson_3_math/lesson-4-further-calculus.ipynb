    "\n",
    "Sequences are perhaps the most fundamental basic mathematical concept you will need in data science, perhaps more so than any other thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence, simply put, is just a series of indexed numbers. The word sequence almost always refers to the concept of an **ordered sequence,** meaning that the sequence describes an underlying mathematical pattern. Elements of a sequence are called **terms** and are typically given an **indexing** of $i$ or $n$. Thus for a given sequence $a$ with $n$ total terms we might write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a = {a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So that the third term of $a$ is $a_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequences can be finite or infinite in number of terms, there are no restrictions. Examples of sequences might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a\\ |\\ a_i = 2i+1, i \\in \\{0,\\ldots,\\infty\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...$$ (sequence of prime numbers) \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a\\ |\\ a_i = a_{i-1}+a_{i-2}, i \\in \\{2,\\ldots,\\infty\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, $$ (fibonacci sequence)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequences are generalized as **series** when we add up the terms of the sequence, yielding a sum. In applied mathematics, it is far more common to discuss series rather than sequences, and we typically discuss those series for which we have a mathematical formula for the terms, as per the examples given above. We discuss this in terms of a summation over the index of the sequence, using the sum symbol, $\\sum$, an uppercase greek \"S\". The lowercase indexing sets the start of the sum, the top indexing is the stopping point of the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above series is a sum from the first term of the series to the $N$th. In python we might try representing the series a as a list:"

    "### Zeno's Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "This ancient concept is most often described as Zeno's dichotomy. Zeno was one of many philosophers who studied this problem, without a complete result. It is likely that the problem existed long before Zeno studied it, however. It is posed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A person must travel some finite distance dAB from point A to point B. Before they arrive at the end, they must first travel half the distance, 0.5dAB, then they must travel half the remaining distance, 0.75dAB, and half again, 0.875dAB and so on. If the remaining distance to the destination is always finite, how is it possible that the person ever arrives at their destination?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Meditate on this concept for a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is it possible that anything gets anywhere if we must first cross half the distance, then half the remaining distance, and so on? Something is missing. This concept is called the **limit**, and was proposed first by Archimedes in determining the [area under the curve of the parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quadrature_of_the_Parabola), using an entirely geometric (equally viable to other methods) method. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, archimedes was interested in the series:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 1 + \\dfrac{1}{4} + \\dfrac{1}{16} + \\dfrac{1}{64} + \\dfrac{1}{256} + \\cdots $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be rewritten:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T_n = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{1}{4^n} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Archimedes solved this by drawing the following self-explanatory figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![geometric_squares](./images/GeometricSquares.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is called the *method of exhaustion*. Although we need an infinite number of squares to completely divide the area of the unit square, we can see that the **area of the square itself is finite.** The sum of smaller squares actually converges to a finite area.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Please read the [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno's_paradoxes#Proposed_solutions) for a longer discussion on solutions that have been proposed for Zeno's paradox.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the finite area is found in the **limit** of the above series $T_n$. \n",

    "### [Limits of Sequences](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/integral-calculus/sequences-series-approx-calc/seq-conv-diverg/v/definition-of-limit-of-a-sequence-and-sequence-convergence)\n",
    "\n",
    "Limits of sequences and series have a clear definition: The limit of a sequence or series $A_n$ is found when we can find a number $L$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}A_n = L$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This exists when we can find some bounding number $\\epsilon > 0$ for each member $M$ where $M<n$ of the series such that the $M$th term of the series is less than $L$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|a_n - L| < \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $n > M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that this means that if we pick a point $M<n$ on the number line, that all successive differences between the next terms and the limit decrease beyond that point, i.e. the numbers are converging to $L$. This special definition means that even if we have series with alternating negative and positive terms, they can converge to a limit as well. \n"

    "\n",
    "Again touching upon sequences, we are interested in whether or not a given sequence converges or diverges. That is to say, if the sequence has a defined limit or not. There are several ways to approach this topic, but the best way is to look at the expansion of the terms as they tend towards infinity. Typically, we focus on the **rate of growth** of elements of the sequence term. \n",

    "\n",
    "More complex cases involve the use of intuition and exploration to determine if it makes sense that a sequence converges (recall we are simply trying to determine that the terms stop expanding at some point, not trying to calculate a sum of terms...yet). For example consider the following sequence:\n",

    "$$ A_n = \\dfrac{n^3+2n^2+1}{3n^3+n} $$\n",

This is because later terms in the series become smaller and smaller, tending towards 0 as they go. Although there are an infinite number of terms in the sum, the terms become infinitely small **as they arrive at infinity**, meaning that the whole sum is finite.\n",

    "## [Generating Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_function)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating functions are exactly like series, in fact, they *are* series in the most important sense. Instead of writing out the terms of a **sequence** directly, they are treated as terms of a series. This makes it easy to discuss and write sequences more clearly and more directly than trying to write them out term-by-term. The generating function allows us to simply generate the needed term of a sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are various types of generating functions, including ordinary generating functions, exponential generating functions, Lambert series, Bell series, and Dirichlet series. The most obvious generating function that we treat in detail here is the generating function of the geometric series:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 1 + ax + a^2x^2 + a^3x^3 + \\cdots + a^nx^n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be written as its obvious generating function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(ax)^n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and as we have seen above, it converges to a single known value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(ax)^n = \\dfrac{1}{1-ax} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating the Fibonacci sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating functions are tremendously important to the study of counting and algorithms, and are the main tool used in the study of analytic combinatorics. You should make yourself familiar with them. As a demonstration of the great power of generating functions and their potential use in computation, we will discuss their application to the Fibonacci sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recalling the Fibonacci numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_0 = 0$$\n",
    "$$f_1 = 1$$\n",
    "$$f_2 = 1$$\n",
    "$$f_3 = 2$$\n",
    "$$f_4 = 3$$\n",
    "$$f_5 = 5$$\n",
    "$$f_6 = 8$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can whip this into a meaningful sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 0, f_0+f_1, f_1+f_2, f_2+f_3, \\ldots $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "And we will construct the generating function for this sequence from the base ordinary generating function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(x) = f_0+f_1x+f_2x^2+f_3x^3+\\cdots+f_nx^n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the $n$th term of the fibonacci sequence is a *coefficient* in our formulation of the generating function. Now we set the elements of each set of members in the sequence to the respective member of the generating function and sum together:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0, 1, 0, 0, 0, \\ldots  = x $$\n",
    "$$0, f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3, \\ldots = xF(x) $$\n",
    "$$0, f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4, \\ldots = x^2F(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Summing up these terms we find that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 0, f_0+f_1, f_1+f_2, f_2+f_3, \\ldots = x+xF(x)+x^2F(x) = F(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have a function defined in terms of recursive multiples of itself, $F(x)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F(x) = x+xF(x)+x^2F(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Gathering terms and solving through:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F(x)(1-x-x^2) = x $$\n",
    "$$ F(x) = \\dfrac{x}{1-x-x^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And so we have a generating function for the Fibonacci sequence. However, it does not yet yield a formula for the nth member of the fibonacci sequence. In order to do so, we need to derive its coefficients. We may proceed by using the method of partial fractions that we learned in middle school - we factor the denominator:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{x}{1-x-x^2} = \\dfrac{A}{(1-\\alpha_1\\ x)} + \\dfrac{B}{(1-\\alpha_2\\ x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we set x = 1, we can get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$-1 = \\dfrac{A}{(1-\\alpha_1)} + \\dfrac{B}{(1-\\alpha_2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "x = -1, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 = \\dfrac{A}{(1+\\alpha_1)} + \\dfrac{B}{(1+\\alpha_2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use elementary math to find solutions for $A$ and $B$ using two equations in two unknowns:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_1-\\alpha_2}} $$\n",
    "$$B = -\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} = -\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_1-\\alpha_2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have a partial fractions expansion of the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{x}{1-x-x^2} = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}(\\dfrac{1}{(1-\\alpha_1\\ x)} + \\dfrac{2}{(1-\\alpha_2\\ x)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the two terms in $\\alpha$ are just geometric series (!) and now we can simplify by opening up the geometric series:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{x}{1-x-x^2} = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}((1+\\alpha_1\\ x + \\alpha_1^2\\ x^2 + \\cdots)-(1+\\alpha_2\\ x + \\alpha_2^2\\ x^2 + \\cdots))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Behold! The first terms cancel, leaving the terms of the sequence described as only a simple fraction involving the sum of $\\alpha$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_n = \\dfrac{\\alpha_1^n-\\alpha_2^n}{\\sqrt{5}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the coefficients of the generating function in $x$, but are also the terms of the Fibonacci sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_n = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\left(\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n-\\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the complex terms of the fibonacci sequence can be represented as a closed form series with trancendental numbers in its formulation, releasing us from the obligation of having to store previous integer terms. Hopefully you can grasp the astonishing and frightening power of this result."

    "A Riemann sum is an approximation to the area under a curve (or length of line) using a set of geometrical objects (usually rectangles or trapezoids). This takes the form of a sum of a function times a finite difference describing the dimensions of the geometrical objects. The geometrical objects' width $\\Delta x = x_{i}-x_{i-1}$ is called the **partition** of x, indicating that the x-dimension has been subdivided into chunks, each chunk  called $x_i$. This process is also called *discretization*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_{i}^{*})\\ \\Delta\\ x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The partitions are normally written as being equal in size, but the point at which we evaluate $f(x)$, $x_{i}^{*}$, can be flexible. In general, we assume that the best possible point $x_{i}^{*}$ is chosen for the approximation at each interval $i$ in the partition. \n",

An [antiderivative](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/integral-calculus/indefinite-definite-integrals/indefinite-integrals/v/antiderivatives-and-indefinite-integrals) has already been discussed in the previous lesson as a simple integral, but is only defined over smooth, continuous functions, unlike Riemann integrals, which are far more diverse and defined in many more circumstances.  \n",

    "The Riemann integral is only used in practice as a theoretical construct, but that should not diminish its conceptual value to you in the case of practical problems. [Numerical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration) (used in practice) is performed with a process much like Riemann integration, and is the most common application of computers in many fields. Symbolic results are used in data science wherever exact solutions are possible.\n",

We do not treat them here in this precourse.\n",
