    "Sequences are perhaps the most fundamental basic mathematical concept you will need in data science, perhaps more so than any other thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence, simply put, is just a series of indexed numbers. The word sequence almost always refers to the concept of an **ordered sequence,** meaning that the sequence describes an underlying mathematical pattern. Elements of a sequence are called **terms** and are typically given an **indexing** of $i$ or $n$. Thus for a given sequence $a$ with $n$ total terms we might write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a = {a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So that the third term of $a$ is $a_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequences can be finite or infinite in number of terms, there are no restrictions. Examples of sequences might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a\\ |\\ a_i = 2i+1, i \\in \\{0,\\ldots,\\infty\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...$$ (sequence of prime numbers) \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a\\ |\\ a_i = a_{i-1}+a_{i-2}, i \\in \\{2,\\ldots,\\infty\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, $$ (fibonacci sequence)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequences are generalized as **series** when we add up the terms of the sequence, yielding a sum. In applied mathematics, it is far more common to discuss series rather than sequences, and we typically discuss those series for which we have a mathematical formula for the terms, as per the examples given above. We discuss this in terms of a summation over the index of the sequence, using the sum symbol, $\\sum$, an uppercase greek \"S\". The lowercase indexing sets the start of the sum, the top indexing is the stopping point of the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above series is a sum from the first term of the series to the $N$th. In python we might try representing the series a as a list:"

    "### Zeno's Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "This ancient concept is most often described as Zeno's dichotomy. Zeno was one of many philosophers who studied this problem, without a complete result. It is likely that the problem existed long before Zeno studied it, however. It is posed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A person must travel some finite distance dAB from point A to point B. Before they arrive at the end, they must first travel half the distance, 0.5dAB, then they must travel half the remaining distance, 0.75dAB, and half again, 0.875dAB and so on. If the remaining distance to the destination is always finite, how is it possible that the person ever arrives at their destination?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Meditate on this concept for a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is it possible that anything gets anywhere if we must first cross half the distance, then half the remaining distance, and so on? Something is missing. This concept is called the **limit**, and was proposed first by Archimedes in determining the [area under the curve of the parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quadrature_of_the_Parabola), using an entirely geometric (equally viable to other methods) method. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, archimedes was interested in the series:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 1 + \\dfrac{1}{4} + \\dfrac{1}{16} + \\dfrac{1}{64} + \\dfrac{1}{256} + \\cdots $$ \n",

    "Which can be rewritten:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T_n = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{1}{4^n} $$\n",

    "Archimedes solved this by drawing the following self-explanatory figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![geometric_squares](./images/GeometricSquares.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is called the *method of exhaustion*. Although we need an infinite number of squares to completely divide the area of the unit square, we can see that the **area of the square itself is finite.** The sum of smaller squares actually converges to a finite area.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Please read the [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno's_paradoxes#Proposed_solutions) for a longer discussion on solutions that have been proposed for Zeno's paradox.)\n",

    "$$\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}A_n = L$$\n",

    "$$|a_n - L| < \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $n > M$.\n",

    "We can see that this means that if we pick a point $M<n$ on the number line, that all successive differences between the next terms and the limit decrease beyond that point, i.e. the numbers are converging to $L$. This special definition means that even if we have series with alternating negative and positive terms, they can converge to a limit as well. \n"

    "Again touching upon sequences, we are interested in whether or not a given sequence converges or diverges. That is to say, if the sequence has a defined limit or not. There are several ways to approach this topic, but the best way is to look at the expansion of the terms as they tend towards infinity. Typically, we focus on the **rate of growth** of elements of the sequence term. \n",

Instead of writing out the terms of a **sequence** directly, they are treated as terms of a series. This makes it easy to discuss and write sequences more clearly and more directly than trying to write them out term-by-term. The generating function allows us to simply generate the needed term of a sequence. \n",

The most obvious generating function that we treat in detail here is the generating function of the geometric series:\n",
