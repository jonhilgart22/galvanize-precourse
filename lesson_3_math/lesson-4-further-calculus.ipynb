    "\n",
    "Sequences are perhaps the most fundamental basic mathematical concept you will need in data science, perhaps more so than any other thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence, simply put, is just a series of indexed numbers. The word sequence almost always refers to the concept of an **ordered sequence,** meaning that the sequence describes an underlying mathematical pattern. Elements of a sequence are called **terms** and are typically given an **indexing** of $i$ or $n$. Thus for a given sequence $a$ with $n$ total terms we might write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a = {a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So that the third term of $a$ is $a_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequences can be finite or infinite in number of terms, there are no restrictions. Examples of sequences might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a\\ |\\ a_i = 2i+1, i \\in \\{0,\\ldots,\\infty\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...$$ (sequence of prime numbers) \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a\\ |\\ a_i = a_{i-1}+a_{i-2}, i \\in \\{2,\\ldots,\\infty\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, $$ (fibonacci sequence)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequences are generalized as **series** when we add up the terms of the sequence, yielding a sum. In applied mathematics, it is far more common to discuss series rather than sequences, and we typically discuss those series for which we have a mathematical formula for the terms, as per the examples given above. We discuss this in terms of a summation over the index of the sequence, using the sum symbol, $\\sum$, an uppercase greek \"S\". The lowercase indexing sets the start of the sum, the top indexing is the stopping point of the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above series is a sum from the first term of the series to the $N$th. In python we might try representing the series a as a list:"

    "\n",
    "This ancient concept is most often described as Zeno's dichotomy. Zeno was one of many philosophers who studied this problem, without a complete result. It is likely that the problem existed long before Zeno studied it, however. It is posed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A person must travel some finite distance dAB from point A to point B. Before they arrive at the end, they must first travel half the distance, 0.5dAB, then they must travel half the remaining distance, 0.75dAB, and half again, 0.875dAB and so on. If the remaining distance to the destination is always finite, how is it possible that the person ever arrives at their destination?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Meditate on this concept for a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is it possible that anything gets anywhere if we must first cross half the distance, then half the remaining distance, and so on? Something is missing. This concept is called the **limit**, and was proposed first by Archimedes in determining the [area under the curve of the parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quadrature_of_the_Parabola), using an entirely geometric (equally viable to other methods) method. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, archimedes was interested in the series:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 1 + \\dfrac{1}{4} + \\dfrac{1}{16} + \\dfrac{1}{64} + \\dfrac{1}{256} + \\cdots $$ \n",

    "Which can be rewritten:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T_n = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{1}{4^n} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Archimedes solved this by drawing the following self-explanatory figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![geometric_squares](./images/GeometricSquares.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is called the *method of exhaustion*. Although we need an infinite number of squares to completely divide the area of the unit square, we can see that the **area of the square itself is finite.** The sum of smaller squares actually converges to a finite area.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Please read the [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno's_paradoxes#Proposed_solutions) for a longer discussion on solutions that have been proposed for Zeno's paradox.)\n",

    "for $n > M$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Again touching upon sequences, we are interested in whether or not a given sequence converges or diverges. That is to say, if the sequence has a defined limit or not. There are several ways to approach this topic, but the best way is to look at the expansion of the terms as they tend towards infinity. Typically, we focus on the **rate of growth** of elements of the sequence term. \n",

    "More complex cases involve the use of intuition and exploration to determine if it makes sense that a sequence converges (recall we are simply trying to determine that the terms stop expanding at some point, not trying to calculate a sum of terms...yet). For example consider the following sequence:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} 2i+1 = \\infty$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "but there are many special cases where the sum of infinitely many terms converges to a single number. This is because later terms in the series become smaller and smaller, tending towards 0 as they go. Although there are an infinite number of terms in the sum, the terms become infinitely small **as they arrive at infinity**, meaning that the whole sum is finite.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine if the series:\n",

    "Using partial fractions we can derive the expansion of the series:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{n^2-1} = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{(n+1)(n-1)} = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{2(n-1)}-\\dfrac{1}{2(n+1)} $$\n",

    "Writing out the terms we find:\n",

    "\n",
    "Gathering the first set of terms ($\\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{1}{4}$) and writing out the rest we see that terms cross-cancel every other n ( look at the first generation and compare it with the third in the above series. The $\\dfrac{1}{6}$ terms cancel:\n",

    "## [Taylor's and Maclaurin's Series Approximations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/integral-calculus/sequences-series-approx-calc/taylor-series/v/generalized-taylor-series-approximation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perhaps the most important thing you can review in this precourse is the concept of Taylor's series.** Make sure to study the above videos carefully. Taylor's series (and by extension, Maclaurin series) are a generalized representation of a function in terms of an infinite series of derivatives. This is particularly important to data science, where oftentimes exact representations of functions are either too cumbersome to handle or difficult to obtain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, taking a few terms of the Taylor's approximation is often an ideal way to make a good estimate of the function in question, assuming that several derivatives of the function exist at the point of interest, $a$. The Taylor's series at this point $a$ is defined at:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = f(a) + \\dfrac{f'(a)}{1!}(x-a) +  \\dfrac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 +  \\dfrac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3 + \\cdots \\dfrac{f^{n}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{f^{n}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Maclaurin series are simply Taylor series taken at $a=0$. These are useful in many cases when the function can be approximated for values of x < 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the Taylor series is computed for its first three or four terms, and these are used as an approximation to the function. We can also compose a definition of a function from a handful of simpler series. Estimations can then be integrated term-by-term to achieve a local value of the integral of that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most famous simple example of the power of this technique is the proof of Euler's formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e^{i \\theta} = cos(\\theta) + i sin(\\theta) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "using Maclaurin series:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ sin(\\theta) = \\theta - \\dfrac{\\theta^3}{3!} + \\dfrac{\\theta^5}{5!} + \\cdots + $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ cos(\\theta) = 1 - \\dfrac{\\theta^2}{2!} + \\dfrac{\\theta^4}{4!} + \\cdots + $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e^{i\\theta} = 1 + i\\theta - \\dfrac{\\theta^2}{2!} - i\\dfrac{\\theta^3}{3!} + \\dfrac{\\theta^4}{4!} + i\\dfrac{\\theta^5}{5!} + \\cdots + $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see if we just multiply the series in $sin$ by $i$ we can reconstruct the above identity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ cos(\\theta) + i\\ sin(\\theta) = (1 - \\dfrac{\\theta^2}{2!} + \\dfrac{\\theta^4}{4!} + \\cdots +) + i(\\theta - \\dfrac{\\theta^3}{3!} + \\dfrac{\\theta^5}{5!} + \\cdots + ) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Find an approximation for $\\int_{0}^{x} cos(t^3) dt $ where $x \\simeq 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Maclaurin series for cosine was given above:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ cos(\\theta) = 1 - \\dfrac{\\theta^2}{2!} + \\dfrac{\\theta^4}{4!} + \\cdots +  = \\sum_{n=0}^{infty}(-1)^n\\dfrac{\\theta^{2n}}{2n!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now just replace $\\theta$ with $t^3$ and you get the appropriate series for $cos(t^3)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^n\\dfrac{t^{6n}}{2n!}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\int_{0}^{x} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^n\\dfrac{t^{6n}}{2n!}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "Generating functions are exactly like series, in fact, they *are* series in the most important sense. Instead of writing out the terms of a **sequence** directly, they are treated as terms of a series. This makes it easy to discuss and write sequences more clearly and more directly than trying to write them out term-by-term. The generating function allows us to simply generate the needed term of a sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are various types of generating functions, including ordinary generating functions, exponential generating functions, Lambert series, Bell series, and Dirichlet series. The most obvious generating function that we treat in detail here is the generating function of the geometric series:\n",

    "Calculating the center of mass of a simple object bounded by two curves is one of the standard tools of calculus that has a clear utility in data science, as it relates directly to the method of moments. You will need to calculate the mass of the simple object using its density (here we only talk about continuous density objects, variable density objects are more realistic).\n",

    "So there's a 74.1% chance a customer will wait 3 or more minutes. In other words, there is only a 25.9% chance that a customer will wait less than three minutes."
