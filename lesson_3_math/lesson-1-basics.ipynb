Typically this structure, the number line, is drawn with negative infinity to the left of the zero and positive infinity to the right.\n",

    "The cartesian **coordinate system** is a direct extension of the concept of the number line, allowing a mapping of a pair of descriptors (x,y) for a single point to a visual representation. The **coordinate system** is created by laying two number lines across each other at (usually) right angles. Each reference line is called a coordinate axis or just \"axis\" of the system, and the point where they meet is its origin, usually at ordered pair (0, 0). The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the perpendicular projections of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances from the origin.\n",
